# NC-News Front End Project

Welcome to **NC News**, a Reddit-inspired news application that allows users to read, create, and interact with articles. This front-end project connects to a custom-built API and offers a responsive user experience.

## Features

### Logging In
- Authentication is not implemented yet.
- Navigate to the login page and select a username from the list to simulate login.

### As a logged-in user, you can:
- Create new articles (via the **"Create"** button next to the login button)
- Comment on articles
- Delete **your own** comments
- Upvote or downvote articles

### Explore Articles
- Filter articles by topic (use the sidebar)
- Sort and order articles using the dropdowns on the home page

Future features I want to build:

1. **Pagination** – Display 10 articles per page with dynamic pagination.
2. **Loading Skeletons** – Use suspense-style loading indicators for a smoother UX.
3. **Authentication** – Integrate with Auth0 for secure user login.
4. **Tooltips** – Add helpful hover explanations for icons and input fields.
5. **Topic Creation** – Allow users to create new topics.
